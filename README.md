 # Daily Java Codes Repository
 Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kunal Bandale. This repository contains my daily Java codes.


## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java codes that I write daily to improve my programming skills. Each code has been reviewed and guided by the Head of the Department (HOD) to ensure that it meets the highest standards of quality and adheres to industry best practices.

The codes are organized by day and can be found in the corresponding directory.

 ## How to Run the Code
To run the Java code in this repository, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Once you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run the Java code using the following commands:

    javac HelloWorld.java
    java HelloWorld
    
Replace `HelloWorld.java` with the name of the Java file you want to compile and run.
