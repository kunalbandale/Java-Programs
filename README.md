Daily Java Codes Repository
This repository contains my daily Java codes, created with guidance from the Head of the Department.

Overview
This repository contains a collection of Java codes that I write daily to improve my programming skills. Each code has been reviewed and guided by the Head of the Department (HOD) to ensure that it meets the highest standards of quality and adheres to industry best practices.

The codes are organized by day and can be found in the corresponding directory.

Directory Structure
The directory structure is organized as follows:

markdown
Copy code
- daily-java-codes/
    - day-01/
        - HelloWorld.java
        - ...
    - day-02/
        - ...
    - day-03/
        - ...
    - ...
Each directory represents a day, and each day contains one or more Java files.

How to Run the Code
To run the Java code in this repository, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the Oracle website.

Once you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run the Java code using the following commands:
